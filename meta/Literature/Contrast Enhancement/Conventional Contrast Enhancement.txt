Global arithmetic operators

By simply multiplying every pixel value with a given number you can gain contrast enhancement.

Contrast stretching

You can redefine the range of pixel intensities by stretching selected regions or compressing a certain band to a lower scale.

Histogram equalization

Automatically define a monotonically increasing discrete transfer function using the histogram data for a better use of the whole range of intensity values.
